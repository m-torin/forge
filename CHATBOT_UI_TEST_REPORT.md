### ‚ùå Issues Identified

#### üö® Critical Issues

1. **Build Error - Module Resolution Failure**
   - **Error:** `Module not found: Can't resolve '@repo/mcp-utils'`
   - **Location:**
     `./packages/ai/src/server/tools/code-quality/mcp-client.ts (180:1)`
   - **Impact:** Prevents proper application compilation and functionality
   - **Priority:** HIGH - Blocking issue

2. **Next.js Development Overlay Interference**
   - **Issue:** Development error overlay blocks user interactions
   - **Impact:** Cannot click on UI elements when errors are present
   - **Workaround:** Error overlay must be dismissed to continue interaction

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Moderate Issues

3. **Sidebar Functionality**
   - **Issue:** Sidebar toggle button shows active state but no sidebar panel
     appears
   - **Expected:** Clicking sidebar button should show/hide sidebar panel
   - **Actual:** Button state changes but no visual sidebar panel

4. **User Profile Settings**
   - **Issue:** Cannot test user profile functionality due to overlay
     interference
   - **Status:** Testing blocked by development overlay

5. **File Attachment Feature**
   - **Issue:** Cannot fully test file upload due to interface blocking
   - **Note:** "Choose File" button is visible but interaction blocked

#### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Minor Issues

6. **Console Errors**
   - Multiple 500 Internal Server Error messages
   - React DevTools installation prompts

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Fix Module Resolution**

   ```bash
   # Check if @repo/mcp-utils package exists and is properly linked
   pnpm list @repo/mcp-utils
   # Ensure proper pnpm workspace configuration
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Address Development Environment**
   - Configure development environment to handle error overlays better
   - Consider suppressing non-critical error overlays during testing

### Medium Priority

3. **Investigate Sidebar Implementation**
   - Verify sidebar component is properly imported and rendered
   - Check CSS/styling for sidebar panel visibility

4. **Test File Upload Feature**
   - Once overlay issues resolved, test file attachment functionality
   - Verify file upload limits and supported formats

### Long Term

5. **Error Handling Improvements**
   - Reduce console error frequency
   - Implement better error boundaries
   - Improve resource loading reliability

## Testing Environment Details

- **Browser:** Chromium (via Playwright)
- **Resolution:** Default viewport
- **Network:** Local development server
- **Testing Framework:** Playwright MCP with automated interactions

## Screenshots Captured

1. `chatbot-initial-state.png` - Initial interface in dark mode
2. `theme-toggle-test.png` - Interface after theme toggle (light mode)
3. `after-chat-response.png` - Chat interface with build error overlay

## Conclusion

The chatbot interface has good core functionality with working model selection,
theme toggling, and chat initiation. However, the critical build error must be
resolved for full functionality. The sidebar issue needs investigation, and the
development environment needs optimization for better testing and user
experience.

**Overall Status:** üî∂ PARTIALLY FUNCTIONAL - Core features work but critical
build issue prevents full operation.
