/**
 * Client-side internationalization exports for Next.js
 *
 * This file provides client-side internationalization functionality specifically for Next.js applications.
 * Use this in client components, browser environments, and client-side routing.
 *
 * For non-Next.js applications, use '@repo/internationalization/client' instead.

// Re-export all client functionality
export * from './client';

// Link component has been moved to @repo/uix-system/shared/i18n
// Import I18nLink directly from there instead of from this package
