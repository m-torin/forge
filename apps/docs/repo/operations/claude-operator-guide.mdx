# Forge Modernization Operator Guide

## Before You Start

- Pull latest `main`, run `pnpm install`, `pnpm repo:preflight`.
- Review `.claude/agent-modernization-plan.md` for current priorities and open
  questions.
- Confirm required approvals (Terraform apply, secret rotation) are available.

## Running `/modernize`

1. `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions > /modernize --plan` to inspect
   upcoming work.
2. Review TodoWrite output and quick-context summary.
3. Launch full run:
   ```bash
   claude --dangerously-skip-permissions > /modernize
   ```
4. Monitor `.claude/memory/tool-audit.log` and TodoWrite for approval requests.
5. Provide approvals when safe; otherwise pause run and coordinate with
   stakeholders.

## During the Run

- Watch quick-context updates for handoffs and blockers.
- Ensure background services (Turbo, Playwright) are tracked in `services.json`
  and terminated when idle.
- Trigger additional verification commands manually if automation unavailable;
  log results in quick-context.

## After Completion

1. Review remediation report draft, quick-context, and `git status` inside the
   worktree.
2. Run any remaining manual checks (e.g., `pnpm repo:preflight`, Lighthouse spot
   checks).
3. Merge worktree:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge --ff-only tmp/modernize-<timestamp>
   git worktree remove tmp/modernize-<timestamp>
   ```
4. Commit changes following repository conventions; include references to
   approvals/tests.
5. Archive tool outputs (Playwright, Lighthouse) under `memory/artifacts/` if
   not already stored.

## Documentation Updates

- Ensure `AGENTS.md`, `.claude/agents/*.md`, `.claude/settings.local.json`, and
  Mintlify entries are updated when automation changes.
- Log doc updates and reviewer sign-off in quick-context + TodoWrite.

## Incident & Escalation

- If automation fails repeatedly or guardrails cannot be honored, pause
  `/modernize`, summarize findings in quick-context, and notify maintainers.
- Use LLM-as-judge when specialists disagree; record verdict IDs in
  quick-context.

<Note>
  Treat this guide as living documentation. Update it alongside
  `.claude/agent-modernization-plan.md` when processes change.
