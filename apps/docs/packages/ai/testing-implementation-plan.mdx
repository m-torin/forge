# AI Package Testing Implementation Plan

**Status**: 🚧 In Progress **Last Updated**: January 2025 **Context**:
Implementing Vercel AI SDK v5 testing patterns (discovered via Context7)

## 📋 Overview

This plan outlines the complete implementation of modern testing infrastructure
for the `@repo/ai` package, transitioning from custom mocks to official Vercel
AI SDK v5 testing patterns.

---

## ✅ COMPLETED WORK

### Phase 1: Foundation & Analysis ✅ DONE

- [x] **Context7 Research**: Discovered official Vercel AI SDK v5 testing
      patterns
- [x] **Gap Analysis**: Documented differences between current vs official
      patterns
- [x] **Review Documentation**: Created `AI_SDK_V5_REVIEW_FINDINGS.md` with
      comprehensive analysis
- [x] **Migration Strategy**: Identified 5-phase implementation approach

### Phase 2: Core Testing Infrastructure ✅ DONE

- [x] **MockLanguageModelV2Factory**: Implemented official mock model factory
- [x] **StreamSimulationFactory**: Created predictable stream testing utilities
- [x] **AISDKMocker**: Built consistent function mocking patterns
- [x] **Test Setup**: Enhanced `__tests__/setup.ts` with proper AI SDK v5 mocks
- [x] **Import Resolution**: Fixed absolute imports and mock exports

### Phase 3: Comprehensive Test Factory System ✅ DONE

- [x] **AITestFactory**: Main factory class following analytics package
      conventions
- [x] **Test Environment Types**:
  - [x] Basic test environment
  - [x] Streaming test environment
  - [x] Telemetry test environment
  - [x] Tool test environment
  - [x] Error test environment
  - [x] Comprehensive test suite
- [x] **QuickSetup Helpers**: Convenience methods for common scenarios

### Phase 4: Test Data & Utilities ✅ DONE

- [x] **TestDataGenerators**: Realistic AI response, tool, telemetry, and error
      data
- [x] **VercelAISDKTestPatterns**: Common test patterns for all AI SDK functions
- [x] **AITestAssertions**: Standardized assertion helpers
- [x] **Comprehensive Demo**: 17-test demonstration suite with 100% pass rate

### Phase 5: Quality & Corrections ✅ DONE

- [x] **Bug Fixes**: Resolved regex patterns and property access issues
- [x] **Terminology Correction**: Fixed "Context7 patterns" → "Vercel AI SDK v5
      patterns (discovered via Context7)"
- [x] **Test Validation**: Achieved 17/17 tests passing (100% success rate)
