# Citation Example

This document demonstrates how citations are rendered in the AI chatbot.

## Example AI Response with Citations

The Earth is approximately 4.5 billion years old [1] and has a diameter of about
12,742 kilometers [2]. It's the third planet from the Sun in our solar system
[3].

Climate change is primarily caused by human activities [4], with global
temperatures rising by approximately 1.1 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial
times [5].

## How It Works

When the AI generates responses with citations like `[1]`, `[2]`, etc., and
includes corresponding URLs in a Sources or References section, the markdown
processor will automatically convert these citations into clickable links.

### Sources:

https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/nasa-knows/what-is-earth-58.html
[3] https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/earth/overview/ [4]

## Implementation Details

The citation processing is handled by a custom remark plugin
(`remark-citations`) that:

1. Scans the document for citation patterns like `[1]`, `[2]`, etc.
2. Looks for corresponding URLs in the Sources/References section
3. Converts the citations to proper markdown links
4. Styles citation links differently from regular links (blue-600 with medium
   font weight)

This ensures that when users see citations in AI responses, they can click on
them to verify the sources.
