# AI Hints Overview

This directory contains AI-optimized documentation specifically designed to help
Claude Code work more efficiently with this codebase.

## Structure

- **[Task Templates](/ai-hints/task-templates)** - Ready-to-use code templates
  for common tasks
- **[AI Prompting](/ai-hints/ai-prompting)** - Effective prompting strategies
  for AI-assisted development
- **[Decision Trees](/ai-hints/decision-trees)** - Flowcharts for making correct
  technical decisions
- **[Command Sequences](/ai-hints/command-sequences)** - Step-by-step workflows
  for frequent operations
- **[Success Markers](/ai-hints/success-markers)** - Checklists to verify task
  completion
- **[Quick Reference](/ai-hints/quick-reference)** - Summary of all packages and
  their key details
- **[Environment Configuration](/ai-hints/environment-configuration)** -
  Environment variable management with SafeEnv pattern
- **[Package Hints](/ai-hints/packages)** - Detailed guidance for specific
  packages

## How to Use These Hints

1. **Start with CLAUDE.md** - The root file contains essential rules and
   restrictions
2. **Check Decision Trees** - When unsure about architectural choices
3. **Use Task Templates** - Copy and adapt templates for common tasks
4. **Follow Command Sequences** - For multi-step operations
5. **Verify with Success Markers** - Ensure tasks are completed correctly
6. **Consult Package Hints** - For package-specific guidance

## Key Principles

- **Patterns over memory** - Follow established patterns rather than trying to
  remember specifics
- **Fail fast** - Run verification commands frequently
- **Single source of truth** - These hints are the authoritative AI reference
- **Concise and actionable** - Every hint should lead to immediate action

## When to Reference

- Starting a new feature
- Debugging build or type errors
- Choosing between implementation approaches
- Working with unfamiliar packages
- Verifying task completion

## Updates

These hints are maintained alongside the codebase. When patterns change, these
documents are updated to reflect the new approaches.
