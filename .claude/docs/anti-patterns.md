## üö® CRITICAL: Delegation Bypass Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern 1: Main Session Does Implementation (Session 3 Catastrophe)

**The Violation:**
Main session receives slash command (e.g., `/fullservice`), reads product requirements, then **implements directly** instead of delegating to orchestrator.

**Real Example - Session 3 (2025-10-06):**
```
‚ùå User runs: /fullservice
‚ùå Main session reads fullservice.md requirements
‚ùå Main session thinks: "I'll fix these issues myself"
‚ùå Main session edits 44 files directly on main branch
‚ùå 0 Task() delegations
‚ùå Bypass complete
```

**Impact:**
- **Process**: Violated 3-tier PM‚ÜíEM‚ÜíEngineer delegation model
- **Safety**: No specialist knowledge applied, no distributed verification
- **Quality**: No domain expertise, no quality gates enforced by specialists
- **Precedent**: Set dangerous pattern for future sessions
- **Technical**: Work was correct, but process was catastrophically wrong

**Detection:**
```bash
# Check for delegation bypass in completed session
grep -c "Task(" .claude/memory/tool-audit.log
# Should be ‚â•2 for /fullservice sessions (main‚Üíorchestrator, orchestrator‚Üíspecialists)
# Session 3: Found 0

# Check memory for specialist involvement
grep "owner.*docs\|stack-\|agentic" .claude/memory/quick-context.md
# Session 3: No matches found
```

**Prevention:**
1. ‚úÖ Slash commands now force immediate `Task(orchestrator)` call
2. ‚úÖ `permission_mode: manual` adds friction
3. ‚úÖ Pre-commit hook validates delegation count
4. ‚úÖ Validation script checks for orchestrator implementation violations
5. ‚úÖ Documentation clearly defines PM/EM/Engineer roles

**Remediation Applied:**
- Updated `.claude/commands/fullservice.md` with immediate delegation requirement
- Updated `.claude/commands/modernize.md` with same pattern
- Created `.git/hooks/pre-commit` with delegation validation
- Enhanced `scripts/validate.mjs` with bypass detection
- Added 3-tier architecture to `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/AGENTS.md`

### Anti-Pattern 2: Orchestrator Does Implementation (Session 2)

**The Violation:**
Orchestrator agent (Engineering Manager) receives requirements from slash command, then **implements code directly** instead of delegating to specialist engineers.

**Real Example - Session 2 (2025-10-06):**
```
‚ùå Orchestrator receives: "Fix README agent count, update memory docs, fix tsup config"
‚ùå Orchestrator thinks: "These are trivial, I'll do them myself"
‚ùå Orchestrator edits README.md directly (should delegate to docs specialist)
‚ùå Orchestrator edits tsup config directly (should delegate to foundations specialist)
‚ùå Minimal Task() delegations to specialists
```

**Impact:**
- **Role Confusion**: Engineering Managers coordinate, they don't code
- **Knowledge Gap**: Specialist learnings not captured
- **Verification**: Missing domain expert review
- **Scalability**: Orchestrator becomes bottleneck

**Detection:**
```bash
# Check orchestrator implementation in quick-context
grep -i "orchestrator.*edit\|orchestrator.*write\|orchestrator.*fixed" .claude/memory/quick-context.md

# Check for specialist owners in TodoWrite
grep "owner.*:" .claude/memory/quick-context.md | grep -v "orchestrator"
# Session 2: Few specialist owners found
```

**Prevention:**
1. ‚úÖ Updated `.claude/agents/orchestrator.md` with "EM doesn't code" rules
2. ‚úÖ Added delegation decision matrix (ALWAYS delegate implementation)
3. ‚úÖ Added startup role verification checklist
4. ‚úÖ Validation script checks for orchestrator editing *.ts, *.tsx, *.js, *.jsx, *.md files

**Correct Pattern:**
```typescript
// ‚ùå WRONG: Orchestrator edits directly
Edit({
  file_path: "README.md",
  old_string: "16-Agent System",
  new_string: "18-Agent System"
})

// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Orchestrator delegates to docs specialist
TodoWrite({
  todos: [{
    content: "Update README agent count (16 ‚Üí 18)",
    status: "handoff",
    owner: "docs",
    activeForm: "Delegating README update to docs specialist"
  }]
})

Task({
  subagent_type: "docs",
  description: "Update README agent count",
  prompt: "Update README.md agent system table from 16 to 18 agents..."
})
```

### Anti-Pattern 3: "Quick Fix" Rationalization

**The Violation:**
Thinking "It's just one line / too trivial to delegate / faster if I do it myself" to justify bypassing delegation.

**Why It's Wrong:**
1. **Builds bad habits**: Small bypasses normalize larger ones
2. **Loses knowledge**: Specialists don't learn the pattern
3. **Misses issues**: Domain experts would catch edge cases
4. **Violates architecture**: PM/EM/Engineer roles exist for a reason

**Correct Thinking:**
- "Delegation builds specialist knowledge bases"
- "Specialists catch issues I'd miss"
- "Coordination is my value-add, not implementation"
- "Every delegation strengthens the system"

## Delegation Rules Summary

### ‚úÖ Main Session (Product Manager)
- **CAN**: Read slash command, define WHAT
- **MUST**: Delegate immediately to orchestrator via `Task(orchestrator)`
- **CANNOT**: Read files, edit files, run commands, make any implementation decisions

### ‚úÖ Orchestrator (Engineering Manager)
- **CAN**: Read files for analysis, coordinate specialists, update memory checkpoints
- **MUST**: Delegate ALL implementation to domain specialists
- **CANNOT**: Edit *.ts, *.tsx, *.js, *.jsx, *.md (except .claude/memory/*.md), run implementation commands
- **EXCEPTION**: Can edit `.claude/memory/quick-context.md`, `checkpoint-*.md`, `*-learnings.md`

### ‚úÖ Specialists (Engineers)
- **CAN**: Edit files in their domain, run tests, make changes
- **MUST**: Stay in domain boundaries, report to orchestrator
- **CANNOT**: Work outside domain, bypass orchestrator

---

## Prompt & Planning Issues

### Issue: Scope Creep During AUDIT
**Symptom**: AUDIT phase identifies gaps, session immediately tries to fix everything
**Fix**: Focus on core mission, defer low-priority items
**Reference**: `.claude/commands/fullservice.md` - "Scope Boundaries" section

### Issue: Missing TodoWrite Specialist Owners
**Symptom**: TodoWrite entries lack `owner` field
**Fix**: Every task must have specialist owner (docs, stack-*, foundations, etc.)
**Detection**: Validation script checks for specialist owners in quick-context

---

## Automation Hook Pitfalls

### Pitfall: Pre-commit Hook Blocks Legitimate Documentation
**Symptom**: Updating delegation system docs triggers "insufficient delegation" error
**Fix**: Added whitelist in `scripts/validate.mjs`
**Whitelisted**: Templates, quick-context.md, validation scripts, hooks, delegation docs

### Pitfall: Bash CWD Reset in Worktree Operations
**Symptom**: Bash tool resets working directory between commands
**Fix**: Always prefix with `cd "$WORKTREE_PATH" &&`
**Reference**: `.claude/docs/fullservice-flow-diagram.md` - Tool Usage Priority

---

## Security Concerns

### Risk: Direct Secret Edits Without Approval
**Pattern**: Modifying .env files, secrets in configs
**Mitigation**: Terraform/secrets changes require explicit user approval
**Reference**: `.claude/agents/orchestrator.md` - Escalation section

### Risk: Running `pnpm dev` in Autonomous Mode
**Pattern**: Starting dev servers during automation
**Mitigation**: `pnpm dev` explicitly forbidden in CLAUDE.md
**Reason**: Autonomous sessions don't need dev servers, prevents port conflicts

---

## Testing Gaps

### Gap: No E2E Tests for Delegation Flow
**Issue**: Can't automatically test PM‚ÜíEM‚ÜíEngineer delegation
**Mitigation**: Manual testing guide in `.claude/docs/testing-fullservice.md`
**Future**: Automated delegation flow tests

### Gap: Pre-commit Hook Only Runs on Memory Changes
**Issue**: Hook only triggers when `.claude/memory/` files are staged
**Reason**: Avoids blocking normal development commits
**Trade-off**: Delegation violations in non-automation sessions not caught
